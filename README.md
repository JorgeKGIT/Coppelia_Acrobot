A little project about solving the acrobot problem with an implementation using the NEAT algorithm in python.

Here is presented a simulation with CoppeliaSim of the Acrobot, a robot double pendulum with 2 joints but can only control the second one, and the objective is to reach the maximum altitude with the second arm.

Applying NEAT-python implementation to create a reinforcement learning solution so the acrobot can lift itself up.
